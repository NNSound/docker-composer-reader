# Docker-Composer-Reader

I have too many container in my docker-compose.yml, and it cost me so much time to find the correct port. Hope this can save your time to find some info in docker-compose.yml.  
  
You would get a csv file name output.csv, make sure your docker-compose.yml in right path  
  
Run:
```
python3 ymlReader.py
```
